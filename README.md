# :robot: Tuples, Lists and Dictionaries

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

In this lab we will begin to explore three new data types in Python.  These three may be used to expand the capabilities of our code significantly. If you need to store a long list of information which may or may not need to change or need to be indexed, these concepts will be very useful.

The goal of this lab assignment is to introduce you to these data types and how to use them in Python scripts. 🚀

#### Over the course of this lab you will do a number of things:
1. Create lists, tuples and dictionaries using Python syntax.
2. Utilize some of the methods in Python to modify existing examples of these three data types.
3. Use correct syntax to find and request values from various parts of your data.

## 💻 Terms to know
- lists
- tuples
- dictionaries
- arrays
- `.append()`

## 📝 Next steps
1. Complete the work in the notebook here (5_5_3_Tuples,_Lists_and_Dictionaries.ipynb) using the CoLab interface.
2. Using GIT, add the repo to your raspberry pi.
3. Using NANO and the terminal in your pi, create a new text file called "observations.txt" and write what you learned in this lab.
4. Commit and Push the code to your repo so that I will be able to read your new text file from GitHub.
